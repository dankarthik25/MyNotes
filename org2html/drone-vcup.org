* What is vCPU ?
- Also know as virtual centralized processing unit.
- As for a definition, a vCPU represents a portion or share of the underlying, physical CPU that is assigned to a particular virtual machine (VM).
** Physical Core:
A physical core, also referred to as processing units, within the CPU. A single physical core may correspond to one or more logical cores.
** Logical Core:
A logical core makes it possible for a single physical core to perform two or more actions simultaneously.
* How Does a vCPU Work?
- Virtual servers and their resource allocation are controlled by what is known as a hypervisor.
- The hypervisor uses a portion of the physical CPU computing resources and allocates it to a vCPU which is assigned to a specific VM.  
- Some IT experts consider the concept behind vCPUs as a share of the time spent on the processor’s core.
- System administrators can use hypervisors to setup different resource allocations where specific VMs are configured with specific vCPU capabilities.
* How Do You Calculate vCPU?
* How many vCPU are in a CPU?
* What are cores?*
- We’ll go into detail on the mathematics and you’ll have a clear idea of how to calculate the number of vCPUs that you require for your cloud servers.
  
A lot of this will depend on your specific requirements and the manufacturer.
- *The Math Behind Calculating vCPU*
  In the past, there was a rule of thumb that there were eight vCPUs per core. Today, vCPU count is largely determined by the manufacturer. It’s calculated by taking the number of processing threads that a chipset offers per core and multiplying the number of occupied sockets. Here’s how it looks:
  =(Threads x Cores) x Physical CPU = Number vCPU=


** Example :
- *First, we need to select a virtual server and CPU.*
- For this example, we’ll select Intel Xeon E-2288G as the underlying CPU.
  Key stats for the Intel Xeon E-2288G include 8 cores / 16 threads with a 3.7GHz base clock and 5.0GHz turbo boost.
  There is 16MB of onboard cache.
  =(16 Threads x 8 Cores) x 1 CPU = 128 vCPU=
