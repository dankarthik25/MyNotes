* History of DevOps

Before DevOps, We had two approaches for software development namely the Waterfall and the Agile.
** Waterfall Model
*** Top-down approch
**** Introduction
https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Waterfall-Phases-403x300.png
The waterfall model is a software development model that is pretty straight forward and linear. This model follows a top-down approach.
**** > Requirement Gathering and Analysis[Client + Developers]
This model starting with *Requirements gathering and analysis*. In this phase we  get the requirements from the client for developing an application. After this, you try to analyze these requirements.And make a blueprint of software
**** > Design[Developers +..  ]
The next phase is the Design phase where you prepare a blueprint of the software. Here, you think about how the software is actually going to look like.

**** > Implementation[Developers]
Once the design is ready, you move further to Implementation phase where you begin with the coding for the application. The team of developers works together on various components of the application.
**** > Testing[Testers]
Once you complete the application development, you test it in the *Verification phase*. There are various tests conducted on the application such as unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, etc.
**** > Depolyment [Developers + Testers]
After all the tests on the application are completed, it is *deployed* onto the production servers.
**** > maintenance phase[Operator]
At last, comes the *Maintenance phase*. In this phase, the application is monitored for performance. Any issues related to the performance of the application are resolved in this phase.

*** Advantages of the Waterfall Model:
- Simple to understand and use
- Allows for easy testing and analysis
- Saves a significant amount of time and money
- Good for small projects if all requirements are clearly defined
- Allows for departmentalization & managerial control
*** Disadvantages of Waterfall Model:
- Risky and uncertain
- Lack of visibility of the current progress
- Not suitable when the requirements keep changing
- Difficult to make changes to the product when it is in the testing phase
- The end product is available only at the end of the cycle
- Not suitable for large and complex projects

** Agile Methodology
https://www.hashminds.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/agile3-e1516054093712.jpg
Agile Methodology is a people-focused, results-focused approach to software development that respects our rapidly changing world.
It’s centered around adaptive planning, self-organization, and short delivery times. It’s flexible, fast, and aims for continuous improvements in quality
Agile Methodology is an iterative based software development approach where the software project is broken down into various iterations or sprints.
Each iteration has phases like the waterfall model such as Requirements Gathering, Design, Development, Testing, and Maintenance.
The duration of each iteration is generally (2-8)(1-4) weeks or (1-2 months).

*** Agile Methodology Overview

- It abandons the risk of spending months or years on a process that ultimately fails because of some small mistake in an early phase.It relies instead on trusting employees and teams to work directly with customers to understand the goals and provide solutions in a fast and incremental way.
  - Faster, smaller. Traditional software development relied on phases like outlining the requirements, planning, design, building, testing, and delivery.
    Agile methodology, by contrast, looks to deploy the first increment in a couple weeks and the entire piece of software in a couple months.
  - Communication. Agile teams within the business work together daily at every stage of the project through face-to-face meetings. This collaboration and communication ensure the process stays on track even as conditions change.
  - Feedback. Rather than waiting until the delivery phase to gauge success, teams leveraging Agile methodology track the success and speed of the development process regularly. Velocity is measured after the delivery of each increment.
  - Trust. Agile teams and employees are self-organizing. Rather than following a manifesto of rules from management intended to produce the desired result, they understand the goals and create their own path to reach them.
  - Adjust. Participants tune and adjust the process continually, following the KIS or Keep It Simple principle.
*** model Agile Process
- In Agile, a company releases the application with some high priority features in the first iteration.
- After its release, the end-users or the customers give you feedback about the performance of the application.
- Then you make the necessary changes into the application along with some new features and the application is again released which is the second iteration.
- You repeat this entire procedure until you achieve the desired software quality.
  Benefits of Agile Methodology


**** Advantages of Agile Model
- It adaptively responds to requirement changes favorably
- Fixing errors early in the development process makes this process more cost-effective
- Improves the quality of the product and makes it highly error-free
- Allows for direct communication between people involved in software project
- Highly suitable for large & long-term projects
- Minimum resource requirements & very easy to manage
The benefits of Agile are tied directly to its faster, lighter, more engaged mindset. The process, in a nutshell, delivers what the customer wants, when the customer wants it. There’s much less wasted time spent developing in the wrong direction, and the entire system is quicker to respond to changes. For a more comprehensive list of benefits, see this post.
- Faster. Speed is one of the biggest benefits of Agile Methodology. A faster software development life cycle means less time between paying and getting paid. That, in turn, means a more profitable business.
- Increased customer satisfaction. With Agile, customers don’t wait for months or years, only to get exactly what they didn’t want. Instead, they get iterations of something very close to what they want, very fast. The system adjusts quickly to refine the successful customer solution, adapting as it goes to changes in the overall environment.
- Values employees. Employees whose ideas are valued are vastly more productive than those who are ordered to follow a set of rules. The Agile Methodology respects employees by giving them the goal, then trusting them to reach it. Since they’re the ones with their hands on the controls and the ones who see the obstacles that crop up every day, employees are in the best position to respond to challenges and meet the goals at hand.
- Eliminates rework. By involving the customer at more than just the phases of requirements and delivery, the project remains on-task and in-tune with customer needs at every step. This means less backtracking and less “out on a limb” time between the time we do the work and the time the customer suggests revisions.
**** Disadvantages of Agile Model
- Highly dependent on clear customer requirements
- Quite Difficult to predict time and effort for larger projects
- Not suitable for complex projects
- Lacks documentation efficiency
- Increased maintainability risks
**** The advantages of the Agile Model are as follows −
- Is a very realistic approach to software development.
- Promotes teamwork and cross training.
- Functionality can be developed rapidly and demonstrated.
- Resource requirements are minimum.
- Suitable for fixed or changing requirements
- Delivers early partial working solutions.
- Good model for environments that change steadily.
- Minimal rules, documentation easily employed.
- Enables concurrent development and delivery within an overall planned context.
- Little or no planning required.
- Easy to manage.
- Gives flexibility to developers.

**** The disadvantages of the Agile Model are as follows −
- Not suitable for handling complex dependencies.
- More risk of sustainability, maintainability and extensibility.
- An overall plan, an agile leader and agile PM practice is a must without which it will not work.
- Strict delivery management dictates the scope, functionality to be delivered, and adjustments to meet the deadlines.
- Depends heavily on customer interaction, so if customer is not clear, team can be driven in the wrong direction.
- There is a very high individual dependency, since there is minimum documentation generated.
- Transfer of technology to new team members may be quite challenging due to lack of documentation.

** DevOps
https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devops-a-complete-guide
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology. 

By definition, DevOps outlines a software development process and an organizational culture shift that speeds the delivery of higher quality software by automating and integrating the efforts of development and IT operations teams – two groups that traditionally practiced separately from each other, or in silos.
*** Stages and Tools
source : good explaination  https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-orc0hestrate-devops-tools-together-to-solve
As mentioned earlier, the various stages such as 
 - continuous development, 
 - continuous testing,
 - continuous integration, 
 - continuous deployment, and 
 - continuous monitoring 
constitute the DevOps Life cycle [[img] [https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/devops-explanation.png]]. Now let us have a look at each of the stages of DevOps life cycle one by one.


*** Stage – 1: Continuous Development [ Planning(Requirement Gathering & Analysis + Design) + Coding]
- Tools Used: Git, SVN, Mercurial, CVS and JIRA(Atlassian Company(includes bitbucket,bamboo,Trello))
- Process Flow: https://i.stack.imgur.com/UvZ0M.png
- This is the phase that involves ‘planning‘ and ‘coding‘ of the software.
  You decide the project vision during the planning phase and the developers begin developing the code for the application.
- There are no DevOps tools that are required for planning, but there are a number of tools for maintaining the code.
- The code can be in any language, but you maintain it by using Version Control tools. This process of maintaining the code is known as Source Code Management.
- After the code is developed, then you move to the Continuous Integration phase.

*** Stage – 2: Continuous Integration
- Tools: Jenkins, TeamCity, Travis 
- Process Flow:
- This stage is the core of the entire DevOps life cycle. It is a practice in which the developers require to commit changes to the source code more frequently. This may be either on a daily or weekly basis.
- You then build every commit and this allows early detection of problems if they are present. Building code not only involves compilation but it also includes code review, unit testing, integration testing, and packaging.
- The code supporting new functionality is continuously integrated with the existing code. Since there is a continuous development of software, you need to integrate the updated code continuously as well as smoothly with the systems to reflect changes to the end-users.
- In this stage, you use the tools for building/ packaging the code into an executable file so that you can forward it to the next phases.

*** Stage – 3: Continuous Testing [Build Code + Testing (Test performacne + Test functional + SIT + UAT + Preproduction + Production )]

- Tools: Jenkins, Selenium TestNG, JUnit
- Process Flow:
- This is the stage where you test the developed software continuously for bugs using automation testing tools. These tools allow QAs to test multiple code-bases thoroughly in parallel to ensure that there are no flaws in the functionality. In this phase, you can use Docker Containers for simulating the test environment.
- Selenium is used for automation testing, and the reports are generated by TestNG. You can automate this entire testing phase with the help of a Continuous Integration tool called Jenkins.
- Suppose you have written a selenium code in Java to test your application. Now you can build this code using ant or maven. Once you build the code, you then test it for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). This entire process can be automated using Jenkins.

*** Stage – 4: Continuous Deployment

Tools Used: 
*** Stage – 5: Contionous monitoring

** What is git
- git is free and opensouce VCS (Version Control System) created by linux torvaldss in 2005.
  - Version Control System  mean which is used to track all change in project
- Using git
  -  No data is lost and undo previous data using his
  -  all users can access and share the project
  -  security: outsiders can access and edit the project
  -  git has (distributed repo )

*** TODO Q) git Vs SVN (Subversion)
SVN is centralised VCS , Git is distributed VCS
SVN is still used because of its performance with large files won't be satisfied with Git.
*** In Companys (MNC's) which vcs is used
- general we use bitbucket(atlassian compancy),git,mecury

** GIT BRANCHING MODELING
 IF YOUR TEAM IS DOING CONTINUOUS DELIVERY THEN IT IS SUGGESTED TO FOLLOW GIT BRANCH MODEL. HERE IS A SIMPLE VERSION OF IT
HTTPS://NVIE.COM/POSTS/A-SUCCESSFUL-GIT-BRANCHING-MODEL/

AT THE CORE, THE DEVELOPMENT MODEL IS GREATLY INSPIRED BY EXISTING MODELS OUT THERE. THE CENTRAL REPO HOLDS TWO MAIN BRANCHES(MASTER(ORIGIN) , DEVELOPER)
WITH AN *INFINITE LIFETIME*:
- MASTER :
  WE CONSIDER ORIGIN/MASTER TO BE THE MAIN BRANCH 
- DEVELOP:
  WHEN THE SOURCE CODE IN THE DEVELOP BRANCH REACHES A STABLE POINT AND IS READY TO BE RELEASED, ALL OF THE CHANGES SHOULD BE MERGED BACK INTO MASTER SOMEHOW AND THEN TAGGED WITH A RELEASE NUMBER.

  THEREFORE, EACH TIME WHEN CHANGES ARE MERGED BACK INTO MASTER, THIS IS A NEW PRODUCTION RELEASE BY DEFINITION. WE TEND TO BE VERY STRICT AT THIS, SO THAT THEORETICALLY, WE COULD USE A GIT HOOK SCRIPT TO AUTOMATICALLY BUILD AND ROLL-OUT OUR SOFTWARE TO OUR PRODUCTION SERVERS EVERYTIME THERE WAS A COMMIT ON MASTER

  ANY FEATURE BRANCH FROM DEVELOP MUST MERGE BACK INTO DEVELOP. FEATURE BRANCHES ARE LIMITED TIME BRANCH WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY MERGED BACK TO DEVELOP BRANCH
   
- SUPPORTING BRANCHES:
  DEVELOPMENT MODEL USES A VARIETY OF SUPPORTING BRANCHES TO AID
  - PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN TEAM MEMBERS,
  - EASE TRACKING OF FEATURES,
  - PREPARE FOR PRODUCTION RELEASES AND TO
  - ASSIST IN QUICKLY (BUG)FIXING LIVE PRODUCTION PROBLEMS.
    
  UNLIKE THE MAIN BRANCHES, THESE BRANCHES ALWAYS HAVE A *LIMITED LIFE TIME*, SINCE THEY WILL BE REMOVED EVENTUALLY.

THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BRANCHES WE MAY USE ARE:
  - FEATURE
    ANY FEATURE BRANCH FROM DEVELOP MUST MERGE BACK INTO DEVELOP. FEATURE BRANCHES ARE LIMITED TIME BRANCH WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY MERGED BACK TO DEVELOP BRANCH 

    NAMING CONVENTION:ANYTHING EXCEPT MASTER, DEVELOP, RELEASE-*, OR HOTFIX-*
     
    FEATURE BRANCHES (TOPIC BRANCHES) ARE USED TO DEVELOP NEW FEATURES FOR THE UPCOMING OR A DISTANT FUTURE RELEASE.
    WHEN STARTING DEVELOPMENT OF A FEATURE, THE TARGET RELEASE IN WHICH THIS FEATURE WILL BE INCORPORATED MAY WELL BE UNKNOWN AT THAT POINT. THE ESSENCE OF A FEATURE BRANCH IS THAT IT EXISTS AS LONG AS THE FEATURE IS IN DEVELOPMENT, BUT WILL EVENTUALLY BE MERGED BACK INTO DEVELOP (TO DEFINITELY ADD THE NEW FEATURE TO THE UPCOMING RELEASE) OR DISCARDED (IN CASE OF A DISAPPOINTING EXPERIMENT).
    
  - RELEASE BRANCH
    ANY RELEASE BRANCHES FROM DEVELOP AND MUST MERGE BACK INTO DEVELOP AND MASTER. NAMING CONVENTION(RELEASE-*)
    - RELEASE BRANCHES SUPPORT PREPARATION OF A NEW PRODUCTION RELEASE.
    - ALLOW FOR MINOR BUG FIXES AND
    - PREPARING META-DATA FOR A RELEASE (VERSION NUMBER, BUILD DATES, ETC.).
      
    BY DOING ALL OF THIS WORK ON A RELEASE BRANCH, THE DEVELOP BRANCH IS CLEARED TO RECEIVE FEATURES FOR THE NEXT BIG RELEASE.

    THE KEY MOMENT OFF A NEW RELEASE BRANCH WHEN
    - ATLEAST ALL FEATURES THAT ARE TARGETED FOR THE RELEASE-TO-BE-BUILT MUST BE MERGED IN TO DEVELOP AT THIS POINT IN TIME.
    - ALL FEATURES TARGETED AT FUTURE RELEASES MAY NOT—THEY MUST WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE RELEASE BRANCH IS BRANCHED OFF.
      
  - HOTFIX(BUG-FIX)
    ANY HOTFIX BRANCH FROM MASTER MUST MERGE BACK INTO DEVELOP AND MASTER
    NAMING CONVENTION:HOTFIX-* 

    THEY ARISE FROM THE NECESSITY TO
     - ACT IMMEDIATELY UPON AN UNDESIRED STATE OF A LIVE PRODUCTION VERSION.
     - WHEN A CRITICAL BUG IN A PRODUCTION VERSION MUST BE RESOLVED IMMEDIATELY, A HOTFIX BRANCH MAY BE BRANCHED OFF FROM THE CORRESPONDING TAG ON THE MASTER BRANCH THAT MARKS THE PRODUCTION VERSION.

     THE ESSENCE IS THAT TEAM MEMBERS (ON THE DEVELOP BRANCH) CAN CONTINUE, WHILE ANOTHER PERSON IS PREPARING A QUICK PRODUCTION FIX.
     
** REVERT :
WHEN CODE IS PUSHED TO REMOTE BUT YOU WANT CHANGES BACK FROM REMOTE > LOCAL 
#+BEGIN_SRC SH
GIT LOG --ONELINE # TO GET THE COMMIT ID

GIT REVERT 77592F3   # TO CHANGE CODE FROME TO REMOTE TO LOCAL REPO

# TO CHANGE THE CODE FROM LOCAL TO REMOTE WE NEED TO PUSH FROM LOCAL TO REMOTE

GIT PUSH ORIGIN MASTER


#+END_SRC

** RESET VS REVERT
*** GIT RESET
THE GIT RESET COMMAND ALLOWS YOU TO RESET YOUR CURRENT HEAD TO A SPECIFIED STATE. YOU CAN RESET THE STATE OF SPECIFIC FILES AS WELL AS AN ENTIRE BRANCH. THIS IS USEFUL IF YOU HAVEN'T PUSHED YOUR COMMIT UP TO GITHUB OR ANOTHER REMOTE REPOSITORY YET.
*** THREE TYPES OF RESET 
  |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | TYPE OF RESET | DESCRIPTION                                                          |
  |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | SOFT          | KEEP ALL CHANGES IN STAGGING AREA, REMOVE FROM LOCAL REPO            |
  | MIXED         | KEEP ALL CHANGES IN WORKIND DIR, REMOVE FROM STAGGING AND LOCAL REPO |
  | HARD          | REMOVES ALL CHANGES FROM LOCAL REPO,STAGGING AND LOCAL REPO          |
  |---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
 
- IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS:
  
| TYPE OF RESET | WORKDIR          | STAGGING AREA          | LOCAL REPO | GIT LOG | REMOTE REPO |
|---------------+------------------+------------------------+------------+---------+-------------|
| SOFT          | PRESCENT         | MOVED TO STAGGING AREA | REMOVED    | REMOVED | PRESCENT    |
| MIXED         | MOVED TO WORKDIR | REMOVED                | REMOVED    | REMOVED | PRESCENT    |
| HARD          | REMOVED          | REMOVED                | REMOVED    | REMOVED | PRESCENT    |
|---------------+------------------+------------------------+------------+---------+-------------|

*** TODO REVERT (NEED TO CHECK IF REVERT ALTERING HISTORY OF COMMITS)
BOTH THE GIT REVERT AND GIT RESET COMMANDS UNDO PREVIOUS COMMITS. BUT IF YOU'VE ALREADY PUSHED YOUR COMMIT TO A REMOTE REPOSITORY, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO NOT USE GIT RESET SINCE IT REWRITES THE HISTORY OF COMMITS. THIS CAN MAKE WORKING ON A REPOSITORY WITH OTHER DEVELOPERS AND MAINTAINING A CONSISTENT HISTORY OF COMMITS VERY DIFFICULT.

INSTEAD, IT IS BETTER TO USE GIT REVERT, WHICH UNDOES THE CHANGES MADE BY A PREVIOUS COMMIT BY CREATING AN ENTIRELY NEW COMMIT, ALL WITHOUT ALTERING THE HISTORY OF COMMITS.

- NORMAL MERGE CHANGES HISTORY AND SQUASH MERGE WILL NOT CHANGE HISTORY ALL ORIGINAL BUT NEW COMMIT-ID IS CREATED .

GIT REBASE:
- MOVES THE ENTIRE 2ND BRANCH TO MAIN BRANCH
- RE-WRITES THE PROJECT HISTORY
- WE GET MUCH CLEANER AND LINEAR PROJECT
    
GIT CHERRY-PICK:

** STASHING
IT IS WAY TO CREATE A CHECKPOINT FOR NON-COMMITTED CHANGES.
IT SAVES ALL THE CHANGES TO A TEMPORARY LOCATION SO THE USER CAN PERFORM OTHER TASK SUCH AS SWITCHING BRANCHES, REVERTING ETC.
THESE CHANGES CAN THEN BE  REAPPLIED ELSEWHERE.

- STASH (CLEAR AND STORE) THE CHANGES IN DIRTY WORKING DIRCTORY
- STASH COMMAND ONLY TAKES *UNCOMMIED* CHANGES (EITHER IN WORKING DIR OR STAGING AREA)
- STASH COMMAND FLOW:
  - RECORDS CURRENT STATE OF WORKING DIRCTORY AND INDEX
  - SAVES LOCAL UNCOMMITED CHANGES SEPARATELY AND REVERT WORKING DIR TO HEAD COMMIT
- AFTER THESE YOU WILL GET A CLEAN BRANCH
- WE CAN RE-APPLY STASH CHANGES AGAIN USING STASH POP OR STASH APPLY
#+BEGIN_SRC SH

- ALL USERS CAN ACCESS AND SEND DATA
*** DIFFERENT TYPE OF VCS
- CENRTAL VCS SVN

** TODO Q) FORK AND CLONE
* MAVEN
** What is maven
- Maven is a *java base build tool* which help developers to build (Projects) or  create *artifacts* (jar, war, ear)
         - jar java archive,
         - war web archive ,
         - ear enterprise archive
      - A built tool is used to automate everything related to building the software project.
      - Why Maven ?
        -  Maven comes with POM, most of prj has to use 3rd patry library which also updates with time for this we need our team to share  dependencecy  info(documentation) and all developer need to maually config Prj with this dependencies. But with POM all the dependencecy automate so developers need not spend time conf and documenting 3rd parties or dependencecy.
                    
      - is a *project management  tool* based on concept of Project Object model(POm) which can  manage 
          - project build
          - reporting and 
          - documentation for central piece of information
** TODO Difference btw jar war ear
** Why developers use maven ?
Developers using maven because it provide
  - a standard way to build  the project
  - a clear defination of what  the project consisted of 
  -  an easy way to publish project infor and a 
  - way to share/deploy JAR across serveral  projects
  
** maven repository
- Maven has three repos
  - Local Repo (dir by name .m2 local os where maven is installed )
  - Central Repo (Internet): Created and maintained by apache maven community 
  - Remote Repo (In general for  custome repository  jfrog artifactory is used)
** Why we need maven repo ?
When we run =mvn archetype:generate= it serach for all dependencies in local,central,remote repo and then move them to local repo for next execution
** What is POm.xml
- Contains information about dependencies,project and configuration details used by maven to build project 
- Pom consits of 
  - Description
  - Name and Version, Artifact Type, Source Code Location, Dependencies
  - Plugins
  - Profiles

** Maven Lifecycle and 8  Phases
In general maven lifecycle has 8 phases: [Need to visit : javatpoint.com maven-life-cycle: 8items=> validate,test,clean  ]
- validate          : all necessary information is available and validate the project is correct.
- compile           : compile the source.
- test              : test the compiled source using  unit testing framework. 
- package           : take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR,war
- intergration test :
- verify            : run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
- install           : install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
- deploy            : copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

** Integrate Maven with git
- Step 1: OPS : Create git repo and send to all dev
- Step 2: DEV : clone the repo,create (src, pom.xml) and  push code into github 
- Step 3: OPS : clone the repo,Build artifacts (war file: mvn package)
- Step 4: OPS : push(scp) war file  to dev,sit,preproduct, prod servers

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- Developers will create maven file and in src file they will uploade developer code and push code to github
- OR
- Developerss will 1st create a maven project and then it will write the code then they will version control (git) and upload them th remote repository (github)
*Note* :For Continous Testing & Deployment:  We need to deploy the artifacts to different envirnoment (development, sit (System Integration and Testing),uat (User Acceptance Testing),prod)

** Question and Answer
- Q)Who create src file and pom.xml file ?
  - =mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=world -DartifactId=india -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DinteractiveMode=false= create src dir and pom.xml
  - maven is a project management tool and we need 3 argument: group Id, Artifact Id, Version
- Q) What is actually pom.xml  file
  - Consist of 
    - group Id, 
    - artifact Id, 
    - version
    - dependency-links
    - Link to remote repository 
- Q)For running maven cmd (compile,package,install,deploy)  why it should present in the same directory where pom.xml is present
- Q)why we use build tool 
  - Ex) To build artifacts(jar,ear,war)(java artive,web archive, enterpashilp archive)
- Q) Why it is called maven life cycle ?
  - Ex if we need to run install : we need to go step by step like compile, package, install
- Q) What is difference between Snapshot and Version ?
  - Snapshot : For every realased snapshot is increased or updated.
  - But version is different it not updated or increased for every deployment but for final-deployment Version is updated.
- Q) What is =maven archtype:generate= ?
  - It is a maven plugin use to generate src and pom.xml file
- Q) how to ignore test cases in maven ?
  - mvn install -DskipTests
** Q) how to create multi module project 
  - parent pom - superpom
  -     child pom

* Servers (Tomcat) 
** Introduction
Server contains: 
  - Start and shutdown programs (irctc ticket booking at night 12am)
  - Can be supported to run war or ear files continously
     Ex: sbi.war is copied in to server then sbi site is opend

Type of Servers
 - Webservers - Eg: apache tomcat 
    -  it can be supported only war file it wont support ear files
 - Application Servers : jboss
   - it can be supported  ear file
 - Cluser: 
   - web logics
   - group of servers
   - support ear files  



# By default tomcat server is 8080 
# We can change server in conf/server.xml - conncetor port
# After starting if there is some error then check log file

we are using tomcat 9 server there is 10 but 10 is alpha and 9 is stable version
** Deployment process

├── log                  # If server is not working check logs
└── webapps              # all jar,war files are moved from maven

Deployment Process
- Stop the server process
- take required backups sbi.war-> sbi.war'data'.zip
- Deploy sbi.war(build server (scp * .war $user@$ip :opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.16/webapps/*.war )
  - Deployed to dev,sat,uat,pre-production,production ((development, sit (System Integration and Testing),uat (User Acceptance Testing),prod))
- start the server
- check it in web browser

** Freestyle Overview

- *General* :
  - *Description*:   ___GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF Project for other understanding_
  - *Discard Old Builds* :
    - Determines if  build records for this project should be discarded.
    - Build records include the console output, archived artifacts, and any other metadata related to a particular build.
    - less disk space will be used in the Build Record Root Directory
    - Jenkins offers two options for determining when builds should be discarded:
      - *Build age*: discard builds when they reach a certain age; for example, seven days old.
      - *Build count*: discard the oldest build when a certain number of builds already exist.
  - *GitHub Project*
    - *Project url* :
  - *Project is parameterised* :
    - explain : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmZ3CEW7nH8&list=PL6XT0grm_Tfi21F8O0TvHmb78P2uEmhDq&index=20
    we can add parameter to project while building project.There are different kinds of parameters like
    - =String, Choice,File parameter, Choice Parameter,Boolean Parameter=
  - *Throttle Build* :
    - explain : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKPhg-_my98
    - Enforces a minimum *time period*: _<>_ between builds based on the desired maximum rate (*Number of Build*).
      - *No.of Build* : _<1,2,3>_
      - *Time Period* : _<Seconds>_
  - *Execute concurrent build it necessary*
    - Explain :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQqzmRGrBXA&list=PL6XT0grm_Tfi21F8O0TvHmb78P2uEmhDq&index=26      
               
- *Source Code Management* :
  Maintaining Code by using Version Control tools is know ad Source Code Management.
  - *Git* : __<https://github/......prj.git>_____
- *Build Triggers* :
  In general build is not manually run. It is automated :remotely, periodically,after other build(pipelined),github hook trigger,Poll SCM
  - *Trigger build remotely* : we generate url using token and run it remotely
  - *Build after other project is build* :# it used for pipeline the Jenkins Jobs where sucessfull build of other prj  will trigger this project
  - *Build Periodically* : Crontab based trigger, where it build this project periodically with respective crontab
    - MINUTE	Minutes within the hour (0–59)
    - HOUR	The hour of the day (0–23)
    - DOM	The day of the month (1–31)
    - MONTH	The month (1–12)
    - DOW	The day of the week (0–7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday.
  - *GitHub hook trigger for GITScm Polling* : github is config with hook to trigger jenkins using <url>
    Githhub > repo > setting > githook
    - url of jenkins
    - generate webhook   
  - *Poll SCM* :
    Check github periodically if any new push and automate the build
- *Build Environment*
  - *Delete Workspace before build starts*
    - Explain : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqYWQbpeQ18&list=PL6XT0grm_Tfi21F8O0TvHmb78P2uEmhDq&index=11
    - (discard old build and files  result and start fresh build)
       
  - Use secret text or file
    - password protection
  - *Abort build if it's stuck* (Timeout)
    - explain : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlS3LvtjvFA&list=PL6XT0grm_Tfi21F8O0TvHmb78P2uEmhDq&index=24
  - *Add timestamp to the Console Output*:
    - explain : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA8xb-B5brM    
- *Build* :
  - either build prj using <manven,ant,gradel> or run shell,powershell scripts like <Copy Artifacts from Another Prj> 
  - *Execute shell* :
    Runs a shell script (defaults to sh, but this is configurable) for building the project. The script will be run with the workspace as the current directory.
  - *Execute Powershell* :
    Runs a Windows batch script for building the project. The script will be run with the workspace as the current directory. The text you enter in the text box will be executed as a batch file.
  - *Invoke top-level Maven targents*
    For projects that use Maven as the build system. This causes Jenkins to invoke Maven with the given goals and options. A non-zero exit code from Maven makes Jenkins mark the build as a failure. Some Maven versions have a bug where it doesn't return the exit code correctly.  
- *Post-build Actions*
  - *E-mail Notification*
  - *Build other Projects*  
  - Editable Notification
  - Git Publisher
  - Set Github commit status
  - Delete workspace when build is done

** [12-13 march]master -slave :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dZKT79DUfk
copy D:\jenkins\worksape\sample\target\*.war D:\tomcat\webapps

Find tomcat installation folder
delete hello-world (Note : tomacat server is shutdown then delete)

AIm : directly paste helloworld.war or all war file using jenkins in windows(install powershell plugin )




install java,git, maven in linux aws- server

What is master -slave concepts ?
master ? where your cloud install jenkins
workspace : eg :/roor/.jenkins
            eg :D:/Workspace/jenkins/

consider master in Window and slave is aws-ec2-linux(jenkins is not install)

Aim : all master job should be done in slave (/opt/devops)

Step 1 : Create AWS EC-2 as slave (get ip address, key) and install (java, maven,git) in slave
Step 2 : Create New Node(In Jenkins Node means Salve-server ) and Connect to Node to Jenkins  
*** Step 1: Create AWS EC-2 as slave and install java,maven,git
In genreal we use shell scripts to install java,git and maven in slave node but for lecture we are manually isntall app.

*** Step 2: Create and Connect Node(Slave-servet) to Jenkins(master- server)
- Step 1: Create a Slave :
  - Manage Jenkins > mange Node(Slave) 
     - New Node  
       - Node name : _<Slave-Server Name>_
       - Permanaent Agent : enable
       - OK
- Step 2: Configure Slave
  - executors : 1
  - remote root directory : _/opt/deploy/_  # dir in slave server
  - label            : _orange_
  - Launch method    : _Launch agents via SSH_
    - Host Name   : _18.188.173.210_ <AWS-Public Id>      
    - Credentials : _Jenkins_
       - Kind    : _SSH Username with private key_
       - Usernaem: _ec2-user_
       - Private key : enable
       - key : _<copy the key>_
    - Host Key Verification Strategy : _Non verification Strategy_
  - Node Progeries :
    - Toot Locations :
      - Name : _Java_
      - Home : _/opt/software/jdk1.8.0_131_
      - Name : _maven_
      - Home : _/opt/software/apache-maven-3.6.3/_
- BUG : if java, maven are not present then
  - Jenkins > mangae Jenkins > Global Tool Configuratoin > JDK (Add JDK) , maver(Add maven)
  - manage jenkins > mange nodes
- Step 3: Launch the Slave
  - Go to Slave Node and Lanunch the Node
*** Step 3: Run job in Slave Node
- New Job or Job > Config >
  - General
    - Description
    - Discrad old build
    - GitHub project
    -
    -
    - Restrict where this project can be run
      - Lable : __<Give Slave Node Lable>___
** [14 march]Backup and Restoring point
- Step 1: Install "Backup or ThinBackup"
  - manage jenkins > manage plugins > install Backup OR ThinBackup
- Step 2: Configur  backup
  - manage jenkins > Backup Manager or (ThinBackup) >
    - Setup :
      - Background Configuration:
        - Backup dirctory : D:/paytm
        - Formate : zip/tar
        - File name template : backup_@date@.@extension@
          
- Step 3: Create a backup
  - manage jenkins > Backup Manager or (ThinBackup) >
    - Backup Hudson Configuration [ENABLE] # IT will CREATE BACKUP
      
- Step 4: Restore a backup
  - manage jenkins > Backup Manager or (ThinBackup) >
    - Resotre Hudson Configuration
      - Choose backup_file for backup        
** [12 march]Upstream and Downstream
There are diffrent job and jobs should be executive in order respectively
- world job
- india job
- hyd  job 
How do we auto-mate three jobs in order respectively
*** Create Jobs and pipline the jobs
For World job , {india,hyd} job are downstream and World in upstream
- Create world,india,hyd job 
- Pipeline Job :
  - Job : india job 
    -  Build Triggers :
       - Build after project are build
         - Projects to watch : _________world________
           - Trigger only if build is stable
  - Job : hyd job 
    -  Build Triggers :
       - Build after project are build
         - Projects to watch : _________india________
           - Trigger only if build is stable
             


*** To View Pipeline
- Step 1: Install "Build Pipline Plugin"
  - manage jenkins > manage plugins > install Build Pipeline
- Step 2 : Create a View Pipeline
   - Create a View{Name:Earth} > Build Pipeline View: Ok
   - Inside:localhost:8080/view/Earth/configure
     - Pipeline Flow: 
       - Select Initial Job: world
     - Trigger Options
       - Restrict trigger to most recent successful build : yes
       - Always allow manual tigger on pipeline steps : yes
 - Step 3: Save and apply changes          


*** Example
git [trigger build by change in git-code]
maven [build the code]
deploy [copy the build to tomcat/webapps]
archive artifacts

* Ansible :
** Introduction
*** Before Ansible
sys-admin use to take all time inupdating severs and creating new servers but there  no-time to moniotir servers to know which servers are corrupt/not-functioning servers.
*Configuration Management tool*: organization tool which help manage ,configure and monitor all servers efficienctly
Eg: At New year there was "Mega Sale" so there huge rise in traffic, so we need web servers to handille using(load balancer + servers(increase) + db) in *short period* of time. This is possible by *Configuration Management*
*** Advantages of Configuration Management tool:
- Scalability
  -  before sys-admin manually launch and config servers but with configuration tool we can
  -  automate laucch and configure servers
- work-velocity:
  - when developer pushes code and wanted new testing then  sys-admin take time to configure,during this time developer will be idels which affect the work flow with configuration tool we can maintain work-flow
- Roll back :
  - New Version of software are released beta version some time user/customer are not happy or some bug was present. We need to switch back to older version as quickly as possible this can happen with configuration management
    - *Example: New York Stock*
      - There was a bug in new-software  during lauch which cause loss in stock and they quickly move to old-software which is possible by configuration management tool.
*** Alternative to Ansible (Different Configuration Management tool):
- Ansible ,SaltStack : push based Configuration tool
- Chef puppet : pull based Comfiguration Management tool
*** WHY Ansible
- Configuration Management tool & deployment & Orchestration tool
- push based Conf Mange tool
- automate
- Features :
  - Agentless
  - Simple            
  - Powerfull
  - efficienct
**** Case Study :NASA moving Private Servers to Cloud using ansible [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCQpaTTTv9][Edureka Youtube]]
**** Architechture
- Ansible
  - Automate Engine
  - Inventory
  - Playbook
    - module : lib 
    - plugins : execute ansible-task as jobs,plugins can to action, call-back,
    - api
  - CMDB
  - Hosts(servers) [connect through ssh or ...]

*** Asynchronous Actions
**** Why Asynchronous
Time when we need to execute a long task that excceds the ssh-time out
Insted of extending we  make a check on it later time

To run mulitpule processes at once and check on it later

To run  one or more process and not check it staus
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
- name: Deploy Web Application
  hosts: web
  tasks:
  - command: /opt/monitor_webapp.py
    async: 360 # How long to run ? 
    poll: 60   # How frequently to check default 10 sec?
    register: webapp_result
               # poll: 0 , Not waiting check and go to other task


  - command: /opt/monitor_database.py
    async: 360 # How long to run ? 
    poll: 60   # How frequently to check default 10 sec?
    register: database_result
               # poll: 0 , Not waiting check and go to other task

  - name: Check status of tasks
    async_status: jid={{webapp_result.ansible_job_id}}
    register: job_result.finished
    retries: 30

# Not all module support async
#+END_SRC
*** Strategy
How playbook is executed in ansible
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
-
 name: Deploy Web Applications
 strategy: free
# Batch 
# serial:3(linear for 1st 3 server) later are free strategy
 hosts: server1
 tasks:
  - name: Install dependencies
     ########################
  - name: Install mySQL databases
     ########################
  - name: Start mysql service
     ########################
  - name: Install Python Flask dependencies
     ########################
  - name: Run web-server 
     ########################
#+END_SRC
*** Forks
How many server can it talk to at a time ?
If we have 100 servers ? will servers run at atime ?
How many servers will ansible take at atime ?

Ansible uses parallel process called frok  communicate with host 
default ansible talk 5 servers at atime.
*** Error Handling
In strategy topic we see linear, free, batch

If one server there is error <like  mysql server> then ansible take error out of list and continue the playbook

If we want to stop execution if there is an error in execution use *any_errors_fatal*
**** ignore_errors: 
consider we want to send a mail at end of task telling <Web Server Deployed>
How ever stmp server is not stable so we don't want to give error because of it and stop, FOR this kind of thinks we want to ignore the error
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
- mail:
    to: devops@corp.com
    subject: Server Deployed!
    body: Web Server Deployed
  ignore_errors: yes
#+END_SRC
**** failed_when:
We want to check the *Error log* and see if there is an error in it or not then we want to fail the if error as occured
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
- command: cat /var/log/server.log
  register: command_output
  failed_when: " 'ERROR' in command_output.stdout"
#+END_SRC

*** Jinja 2 Templating(Filters)
What is Templating : process of dynamic content :
#+BEGIN_SRC yml
- 
 name: Test Template Playbook
 hosts: localhost
 vars:
   my_name: karthik
 tasks:
  - debug:
       msg: "my name is {{my_name}}"

#+END_SRC

**** String manipualtion
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The name is {{my_name}}=> The name is karthik
The name is {{my_name | upper}}=> The name is KARTHIK
The name is {{my_name | lower}}=> The name is karthik
The name is {{my_name | title}}=> The name is Karthik
The name is {{my_name | repalce("karthik","Sai Teja")}}=> The name is Sai Teja
The name is {{my_name | default("James")}} {{my_name}}=> The name is James Karthik
#+END_QUOTE
**** List and Set based filter
#+BEGIN_SRC yml
{{ [1,2,3] | min }}                >> 1
{{ [1,2,3] | max }}                >> 3
{{ [1,2,3,2] |unique }}                >> 1,2,3

{{ [1,2,3,4] | interset([4,5]}}                >> 4
{{ 100 | random }}                >> Random number
{{ ["The", "name", "is","Bond"] | join (" ")}}                >> The name is Bond
#+END_SRC
**** File based Filter
#+BEGIN_SRC yml

*** Lookups
If we store hosts and password in csv file we can read the password we can use lookup plugin
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
#$ cat credentials.csv
#Hostname, Password
#Target1, PasswOrd1
#Target2, PasswOrd2


{{lockup('csvfile', 'target1 file=/tmp/credentials.csv delimiter=,')}} >> PasswOrd1
#+END_SRC

There are other type of Lookups like INI,DNS,mongodb

*** Vault
We are storing password in host or inventory file 
Ansible vault help to encript the host or inventory file
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# To encrypth inventory file
ansible-vault encrypt inventory.txt
# $ask for password


# run encrypted inventory file
ansible-playbook test.yml -i inventory.txt -ask-vault-pass

# pass file(vault_pass) containing password
ansible-playbook test.yml -i inventory.txt -valt-password-file ~./vault_pass

# pass script(vault_pass.py) containing password
ansible-playbook test.yml -i inventory.txt -valt-password-file ~./vault_pass.py

# view contant of encrpyted file 
ansible-vault view inventory.txt

# To create an encrypted file 
ansible-vault create inventory.txt
