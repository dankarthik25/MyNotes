* What is artifactory ?
Place to store your packages (artifactory) and maintain repository

scr > binary > package
git > maven > zip,war,exe,docker-image,vagrant

Why do we need to store the package in artifactory ?
- 1. Security of package (if some bugee package abile to hack client)
  2. Process driven (
      In Traditial way of package- FTP|Shared Drive
      - Need to store 30 package in day : 365*30 package
        - How can you NAME, LABEL, CLEAN
      By artifactory is process driven : automate
  3. Dependency Management:
     - Internla Dependencecy (module1 dep on m4 and m4 depen on m5...etc )
     - External Dependencecy  (dependent on external dependenency)
  4. Integrity of package
     - During deploy/download package is corrupted.
       - If you use FTP : we can't check before complete download
  5. Admin:
      user:
      group
      permission
      authenticated
  6. Backup and Cleanup Efficiency
