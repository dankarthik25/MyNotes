* SDLC

* Aglie SDLC :
Project is split into 3-4 sprits
Each sprint is a fixed time: general it  1-4 week
Each sprint slove the most important task
* Release Planning:
List all the requriment(new functionality, enchancement, bug, track)
bug tracking tool: JIRA, BUGZILLA
- User story/ Unique ID
- priority : Highest, Medium, Lower
- timeline / owner
- task [Unique ID]
* Agile, Sprints , Daily Meetings 
#+STARTUP: inlineimages
[[file:./DevOps-Intro/01.png]] 
Split into module/components
Sprints:
module by module development-coding & testing
- Scrum Meeting: Dev/QA team
- Kanban Meeting: Operations team


    
In each sprint :
How do we track and solve the issuse ? meeting 

there will be meeting every day where will discuss
is there a issuse ?
wt we are doing today ?
wt we  complleted today ?
wt are the obstacles do you phase ?

** There are two type of meeting : Scrum, Kanband

- Scrum Meeting: Dev/QA team
- Kanban Meeting: Operations team

When we go to compaines there are
product-based compaine and
service-based compaine : go for other compaine as client

If you go to client and compaine has limited resource
So you will be in product based project then you will attent the scrum meeting 

If you are working in product-based project and you are managing all product-based project to the client optiminzing the resources

Then we will n't be able to participate in all Scrum Meeting when we will be  handing having multiple prj :
- So to track day 2 day activites of multiple prj in agile we go for Kanban Meeting
-
If service-based product  : scram
product based product : kanban

However we may attended scram : If dev and qa team need some help you may attend the meeting
