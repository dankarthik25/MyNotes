** how-to-change-the-project-owner-in-gitlab

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21579693/how-to-change-the-project-owner-in-gitlab

Because one user cannot "own" another namespace (not even admins), the only option to set up a scenario where two users own the same namespace is with a group. Perform the following steps to accomplish this.

- Create a new group.
- Add the user that you want to transfer your project to as an owner member of that group.
- Transfer your project to that group (a namespace you manage because you are an owner).
- Login as the other user, then transfer the group project to the "other user" namespace.

At this point you will be left as a master in the project. You can now remove yourself from the project entirely if desired.
