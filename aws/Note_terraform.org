| Mainly a configuration tool | Mainly infrastructure provisioning tool |   |
| 1. configure infrastructure |                                         |   |
| 2. deploy apps              |                                         |   |

Terraform Architecture & Commands

Example Configuration File



Terraform is a infrastructure as code

any service in aws,gcp,azure,openstack

in aws we are using cloud formation
for azure we are using arm template

But from terraform we can create/maintain clouding services like :
- aws, azure, gcp,docekr,ansible,git,kuberneteics


** Install Terraform
google search : hashcrop

wget $url
unzip file.zip
sh terraform version
./terraform version

#+begin_src 
#cat main.tf
provider "cloudname"{   # cloudname = "aws,azure"
    region = ""
    access_key = ""
    secret_key = ""

}

provider "aws"{
    region = "ap-south-1"
    access_key = ""
    secret_key = ""

}
# ./terraform init # 1st downlaod plugins based on provider

# If you want to use any resources in cloud "aws"
resource "aws_vpc" "myvpc"{
      cidr = "10.0.0./16"
}
#+end_src
